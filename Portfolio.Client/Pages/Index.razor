            Hi, my name is Giacomo.
        </p>

        <p>
            I started programming when I was 15, making telegram/discord bots, then quickly switched to videogames. <br/> 
            I published my first game on PlayStore in 2019 (now it's gone because I lost the project files). <br/>
            Since then, I've been working on many different projects, especially the past few years, when I started studying Game Development at SAE.
        </p>

        <p>
			I created this website to showcase my best projects so far. You can check them out
